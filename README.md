## Factory Method

### What is it?
The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Abstract Factory

### What is it?
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Builder

### What is it?
The Builder design pattern solves the problem of an anti-pattern by providing a clear separation and a unique layer for constructing test data or test objects.

## Singleton

### What is it?
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it.

### More Information

## Prototype

### What is it?
The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the "prototype."
